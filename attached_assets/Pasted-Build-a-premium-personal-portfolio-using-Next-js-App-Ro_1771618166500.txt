Build a premium personal portfolio using:

Next.js (App Router)

TypeScript

TailwindCSS

Framer Motion

No UI component libraries

Clean modular component architecture

Concept:

The website represents a late-night indie lo-fi studio where engineering ideas are composed like music.

This must NOT look like:

A Spotify clone

A DJ website

A neon cyberpunk site

A generic dark dev portfolio

It must feel calm, artistic, warm, and deeply intentional.

Sections fade in gently.

🏠 HERO — “NOW PLAYING”

Full viewport height.

Center content:

Large heading:
“Engineering Intelligence.”

Subheading:
AI/ML Engineer crafting systems in silence.

Below:
Small capsule text:
Currently composing scalable AI systems & solving hard problems.

Below:
Two soft buttons:
[Enter the Studio]
[View Metrics]

Minimal animated waveform (SVG, subtle, slow breathing motion)
Waveform reacts slightly to cursor position (gentle parallax)

Bottom-right corner:
Tiny “ambient toggle” switch:
When enabled:

Slight animated grain texture overlay

🏗 SECTION 02 — SYSTEMS (Track 02)

Layout resembles audio mixing board but abstracted.

Three vertical panels:

AI Systems
Distributed Architecture
Optimization Engine

Each panel:

Looks like a soft rectangular channel strip

On hover:

Slight lift

Accent bar glows softly

Internal diagram lines animate in

Inside each panel:

3 bullet capabilities

Minimal schematic-style visual

Subtle animated connector lines between panels.

Motion must feel slow and smooth (spring easing).

Minimal line graph for rating progression.
Style like audio waveform timeline.
Muted blue line.
No grid clutter.

Below:
Radar chart placeholder for:
DP
Graphs
Math
Greedy
Strings

Use muted tones.
Highest value subtly highlighted in amber.

Animations slow and calm.
