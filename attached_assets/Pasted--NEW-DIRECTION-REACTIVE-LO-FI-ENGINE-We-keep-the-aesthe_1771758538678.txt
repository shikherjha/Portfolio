🎧 NEW DIRECTION: “REACTIVE LO-FI ENGINE”

We keep the aesthetic.

But we integrate:

Tone.js

Web Audio API

Reactive visuals

Meaningful sound

Not autoplay music.

Interactive sound design.

🔥 COMPLETE FOLLOW-UP REPLIT PROMPT

Paste everything below:

Enhance the existing Lo-Fi Engineering Studio portfolio into a fully reactive immersive music-driven experience.

Maintain the existing aesthetic and component architecture but implement the following advanced features:

🎧 CORE CONCEPT SHIFT

Music must become interactive and reactive — not decorative.

The UI must subtly respond to:

Cursor movement

Scroll speed

Section transitions

User interaction

Do NOT autoplay full songs.

Use minimal sound design layers.

🧠 AUDIO ENGINE

Install and integrate Tone.js.

Create a reusable hook:

useAudioEngine()

It should:

Initialize on first user interaction (click)

Create:

Ambient pad synth (low volume)

Soft percussion loop

Vinyl crackle noise (toggleable)

Expose:

triggerHoverSound()

triggerSectionTransition()

setIntensity(level)

toggleAmbient()

Ensure:

Mobile performance optimized

Audio suspended when tab not active

🎛 HERO UPGRADE

Replace static waveform with:

Reactive waveform powered by Tone.js analyser.

Behavior:

Amplitude gently increases on scroll.

Slight pulse when user hovers CTA.

Background radial glow subtly reacts to low-frequency audio.

Add subtle vignette effect.

No loud visualizer bars.

Keep it minimal.

🏗 SYSTEMS SECTION UPGRADE

Each architecture card should:

On hover:

Play soft synth pluck (very subtle)

Slight pulse glow animation

Internal diagram lines animate sequentially

On click:

Low frequency sweep sound

Connector lines between cards:

Pulse slowly in sync with ambient pad

🧪 PROJECTS SECTION — GENERATIVE ALBUM COVERS

For each project card:

Generate abstract procedural background using:

Canvas

Noise function

Project metadata as seed

Examples:

AI projects → flowing curves

Systems projects → structured grid

CP projects → geometric sharp patterns

Hover:

Slight 3D tilt

Light shimmer effect

Short pluck sound

Click:
Modal fades in with soft crossfade audio cue.

🏆 COMPETITION SECTION — RHYTHMIC METRICS

Upgrade radar chart:

Pulse softly in sync with ambient beat

Highest metric glows slightly brighter

Line chart animates with easing curve

Add new feature:

When user hovers a metric:

That metric subtly emits sound pulse

Chart responds with micro ripple

Do not overdo animation.

🌙 AMBIENT MODE EVOLUTION

Upgrade toggle to:

Three states:

Minimal Mode

No audio

Static background

Studio Mode

Ambient pad + soft beat

Reactive glow

Deep Focus Mode

Ambient only

Reduced motion

Lower contrast visuals

Switching modes:
Smooth 400ms crossfade audio + visual transition.

🎮 CURSOR UPGRADE

Cursor behavior:

Small amber dot

Very subtle trailing blur

On hover:

Expands

Plays soft micro pluck

On rapid mouse movement:

Slight intensity increase in background pulse

No exaggerated trails.

🧩 SCROLL-BASED INTENSITY SYSTEM

Create global scroll intensity state:

Intensity = function of:

Scroll velocity

Section depth

Pass intensity to:

Audio engine

Background glow

Particle opacity

This makes the page feel alive.

📱 RESPONSIVE FIXES

Fix sidebar overlap:

Sidebar fixed width 96px desktop

main container margin-left 96px

On screen <1024px:

Sidebar collapses into top horizontal nav

Tracklist becomes scrollable horizontal list

Ensure:
No content hidden behind sidebar.
No overlapping on resize.

🧱 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

Use requestAnimationFrame for canvas visuals

Throttle scroll listener

Avoid re-render loops

Lazy initialize audio engine

Reduce particle count on mobile

🎨 REFINEMENT

Tone must stay:

Calm.
Minimal.
Controlled.

No EDM vibes.
No bouncing bars.
No chaotic spectrum analyzers.

It should feel like:
Engineering inside a quiet studio.

BONUS (IF PERFORMANCE ALLOWS)

Add hidden interaction:

If user clicks rapidly 5 times:
Reveal “Hidden Track”
Show experimental project or fun easter egg.

Keep it subtle.

CODE STRUCTURE

Add:

hooks/useAudioEngine.ts
hooks/useScrollIntensity.ts
components/AudioVisualizer.tsx
components/ProceduralCanvas.tsx

Keep everything modular.
